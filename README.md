# Real-Time Disaster Tracking Dashboard

This project integrates live wildfire and earthquake data from **NASA FIRMS** and **USGS** APIs to visualize natural disaster activity across the globe. It uses a Python data pipeline to clean, enrich, and geo-tag data using **GeoPandas** before visualizing it through an interactive **Tableau dashboard**.

> This project is built with Tableau **Public**
